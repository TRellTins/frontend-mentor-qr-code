## My process

  I started by clearing the default margin and padding. 

  ```CSS
  *{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
  ```

  Then I did the first div that would contain all of my content (content-container) and also styling it to fit mobile first view. I then went and put in the background color for the body.
  ```CSS
  body{
    background-color: rgb(216, 235, 245);
  }
```

Next I created the elements inside the html file and styled them. 

Finally I imported the font family and added it to the h2,p elements.
